Overview
========

The study of molecular evolution is a central topic in biology. The molecular clock hypothesis assumes that genes accumulate mutations at a constant rate over time :cite:`kimura1987`. Moreover, under the consideration that most of the accumulated mutations are neutral, the Poisson distribution models the expected variability. The molecular clock hypothesis has become a cornerstone of modern phylogenetic techniques, which are now standard for studying the evolutionary relationships between species and organisms :cite:`kumar2005`.

It has been shown, however, that the simple molecular clock model fails to universally recapitulate evolutionary trajectories. Observations revealed that in some cases mutations do not accumulate at a constant rate :cite:`ayala1997`. This led to the development of relaxed molecular clocks, in which the rates of mutation accumulation are not uniform across lineages :cite:`drummond2008`. Although these clocks have proven to be more accurate in certain cases, they still face difficulties to model, for instance, overdispersed populations :cite:`bedford2008`. A proper analysis of the time-dependent distribution of the number of mutations in the population is necessary to understand and eventually predict the evolutionary trajectories that take place in nature.

Although previous studies have attempted to abstract molecular evolution as a type of diffusion process in the sequence space :cite:`kimura1987, huynen1996`, little attention has been given to the form of the underlying stochastic process. In our previous work, we showed that non-Brownian evolutionary motions occurred within the lineages of a virus, leading to non-Poissonian distributions :cite:`goiriz2023`. Here, we present PyEvoMotion, a Python tool aimed to infer a generalized molecular clock model upon bulk genomic data analysis, featuring a command-line interface and enough modularity for integration into larger Python pipelines. PyEvoMotion is intended to complement traditional phylogenetic analyses.

Traditional phylogenetic methods, while powerful, face computational limitations when applied to large datasets. Indeed, analyzing more than :math:`10^4` sequences becomes impractical due to the exponential complexity of reconstructing evolutionary trees :cite:`chor2005`. To overcome this bottleneck, statistical approaches provide a viable alternative :cite:`goiriz2023, obermeyer2022`. These methods simplify the representation of evolutionary relationships by focusing on patterns of population genetics rather than exhaustive tree reconstruction based on genetic variation. PyEvoMotion leverages stochastic mathematical modeling to assess evolutionary trends, aiming to process datasets orders of magnitude larger than those typically analyzed. This capability is essential for handling the unprecedented volume of genomic data generated by high-throughput sequencing efforts :cite:`oude2020`.
